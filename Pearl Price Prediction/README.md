I came across a dataset on Kaggle that you may be interested in. You can access it at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds
Using the Random Forest Regression method, I was able to predict the cost of a pearl, and I also made use of some visualization tools to present some information in a graphical format. I hope you find this code beneficial.
